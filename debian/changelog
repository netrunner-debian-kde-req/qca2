qca2 (2.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable compilation of unit tests. As the plugins necessary to actually
    execute the tests are not available at compile time, and the compiled
    tests are not included in the packages, it's not actually useful to
    compile them in the first place. Additionally, some of the files need
    a huge amount of memory to compile and therefore take excessively long
    to compile on buildds with little memory.
